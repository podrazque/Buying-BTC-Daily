# Buying-BTC-Daily
An analysis of buying BTC daily since mid 2016 until now.

In 2016 I started buying BTC daily for a few months. I decided to sell to have a downpayment for my car. This is an analysis to see how my bank account would be looking if I was a bit wiser back then.

I'll probably account for inflation when I'm bored.
